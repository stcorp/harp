                HARP 1.26 Release Notes


HARP is a toolset for ingesting, processing and inter-comparing satellite or
model data against correlative data. The toolset is composed of a set of
command line tools, a C library of analysis functions, and import/export
interfaces for Python, R, Matlab, and IDL. The main goal of HARP is to assist
in the inter-comparison of data sets. By appropriatelty chaining calls to
the HARP command line tools one can preprocess satellite, model, and/or
correlative data such that two datasets that need to be compared end up
having the same temporal/spatial grid, same data format/structure, and same
physical unit.

The main functionalities of HARP are:
 - ingestion of product data for:
   - ACE FTS L2
   - ADM-Aeolus L1b/L2a/L2b
   - Aura OMI/TES/MLS/HIRDLS L2 + OMI L3
   - CALIPSO (Lidar L2)
   - CLOUDNET classification L2
   - AERLINET
   - ECMF GRIB (includes CAMS global model data)
   - ENVISAT GOMOS/MIPAS/SCIAMACHY L1/L2
   - ERS GOME L1/L2
   - ESA CCI Aerosol/Cloud/GHG/Ozone
   - GEOMS FTIR/Lidar/MWR/Pandora/Sonde/UVVIS-DOAS data (NDACC/EVDC)
   - GOSAT FTS L1/L2
   - Metop GOME-2/IASI L1/L2
   - NPP Suomi (CrIS/OMPS/VIIRS) L2
   - ODIN OSIRIS/SMR L2
   - QA4ECV NO2/HCHO L2
   - Sentinel 5P L1/L2
   - TEMIS ozone fields
 - import/export of data from/into HARP-specific data format
   The HARP data format standard is a convention on top of netCDF3/HDF4/HDF5
 - advanced filtering of product data
 - automatic unit conversion of quantities using udunits2
 - automatic generation of quantities ('derived variables') based on
   available product data: you just say which quantity you want, and if HARP
   has an algorithm for it and the necessary inputs quantities are in the
   product, HARP will automatically do all calculations for you
 - regridding in any dimension
 - vertical smoothing of atmospheric profiles
 - creating L3 grids
 - built-in AFGL86 and USSTD76 climatology data
 - C Library interface to all core functionality
 - direct import/export interfaces for Python, R, Matlab, and IDL
 - command line tools harpcheck, harpcollocate, harpconvert, harpdump, and
   harpmerge
 - extensive documentation, including specification of algorithms used for
   the variable derivations.
