~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The csv output of 'harpdump --dataset' can now be used as content of a .pth
  file. This improves the performance of harpcollocate/harpmerge/etc. as they
  no longer need to open and extract metadata from files themselves anymore.

* harpcollocate now stores differences as signed values in collocation result
  file (instead of absolute differences).

* Added harp_dataset_prefilter(). This function is now also called within
  harpmerge and harpcollocate to pre-filter the input dataset(s) for datetime
  and collocate left/right filters that are at the start of the operations
  string.

* Added format and history fields to harp_product_metadata.

* Added harp.import_product_metadata() to Python interface.

* harp_dataset_add_product() now ignores files/directories starting with '.'.

* Added uncertainty propagation to bin() and bin_spatial() operations
  (using uncorrelated assumption for bin() and correlated for bin_spatial()).

* Added global option to determine whether uncertainty propagation should
  use a correlated or uncorrelated approach. Currently only used for the bin()
  operation.

* Added global option to create a collocation_datetime variable when performing
  a collocate_left() or collocate_right() operation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added derivations to retrieve column number density from column vmr.

* Fixed issue in bin_spatial() where the weightfactor could be too high when
  oversampling the input data. Grid cells that intersected with the data
  polygon could end up with a weightfactor >1.0 (but <2.0).

* Fixed issue where molar mass was incorrectly provided for the species with
  the shortest matching name. e.g. the molar mass of CO was returned for CO2
  and of NO for NO2. This impacts vmr <-> mmr conversions for BrO2, COF2, COS,
  CO2, C2H2O2, H2O2, NOCl, NO2, N2O, N2O5, and all isotopologues (e.g. H2O_161).

* Removed irrelevant harp_str64() and harp_str64u() functions (HARP does not
  support 64bit integers).

  and 'weight' variables. The counts/weights are used to allow the following
  commands to now be equivalent:
    harpmerge -a 'bin()' -ap 'bin()' a.nc b.nc merged.nc
    harpmerge -ap 'bin()' a.nc b.nc merged.nc
  As well as the following:
    harpmerge -a 'bin_spatial(...)'
      -ap 'squash(time, (latitude_bounds, longitude_bounds));bin()'
      a.nc b.nc merged.nc
    harpmerge -ap 'bin_spatial(...)' a.nc b.nc merged.nc

0.3 2016-09-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The changes between 0.2 and 0.3 are extensive. The list below provides the
  most important aspects, but there are many more smaller changes that are not
  listed.

* HARP 'actions' are now called 'operations' and are now executed in a strict
  sequence. This means that you can now do things like:
    'derive(var); var < 10; exclude(var)'

* Added harpprofile command line tool that allows regridding and smoothing
  of vertical gridded data. 
  Also added harp_product_regrid_vertical_with_axis_variable(),
  harp_product_regrid_vertical_with_collocated_dataset(), and
  harp_product_smooth_vertical() to C interface.

  HARP documentation.

* Introduced a more strict definition of variable names for the HARP data
  format. As part of this the list of supported species and associated naming
  has also been revised.

* Introduced strict separation between dry air and total/wet air. The default
  air density in HARP is now the total/wet air. Anything related to dry air
  should now be annotated as such in the variable name. As a result, 'dry_air'
  is now introduced as a species, and for mixing ratios the '_wet' postfix is
  removed and the '_dry_air' postfix is introduced.
  Derived variable conversions have been added for dry/wet conversion and for
  retrieving the needed 'molar mass' of total air.

  public C library interface. The collocation result interface in the C
  libraryinterface has also been reworked to now work with HARP Datasets.

  now captured by the new Product Metadata interface).

* Added public functions to allow raising/capturing of warnings in HARP:
  harp_report_warning(), harp_get_warning_handler(), harp_set_warning_handler()

* Added public functions to print product/variable structure and content:
  harp_product_print(), harp_variable_print(), harp_variable_print_data()

* Fixed issue in the HARP Python interface where using the value 0 for
  valid_min or valid_max did not work.

* Added concatenate() function to HARP Python interface.

* The 'include()' action/operation has been renamed to 'keep()'.

* The derived variable conversions are now properly split according to the
  dimension types of a variable. This also solves a problem where certain
  valid conversions where not included in a '--list-conversions' print.

* The derived variable conversions that produce uncertainty and covariance
  variables filled with NaNs from scratch have been removed.

* Added derived variable conversions for gridded data (i.e. variables that
  depend on the latitude and longitude dimensions).

* Removed variables flag_am_pm and flag_day_twilight_night and the conversions
  for flag_am_pm, flag_day_twilight_night, and flag_daytime. These conditions
  can all be determined by directly comparing against the solar angles.

* Added support for ingestion of GOMOS L2, SCIAMACHY L2, ECMF GRIB and TEMIS
  assimilated ozone data.

* Added 'species' ingestion option to the MIPAS L2 ingestion.

* Added support for MLS CH3Cl, CH3CN, and CH3OH products.

* Fixed issue in GEOMS ingestion where long variable names were truncated.

* Introduced convention that dimensionless quantities should have an empty
  'units' attribute string value. Only non-quantities should omit the 'units'
  attribute.

* Resolved incorrect correction for leap seconds in product ingestions.

* Covariance variables have been renamed from '*_cov' to '*_covariance'.

* The split of random/systematic for covariances has been removed.
  For ingested products that had such covariances, the random covariances are
  now retrieved as plain covariances and from systematic covariances only the
  trace is retrieved and provided as a systematic uncertainty.

* Added 'geopotential' as a supported quantity with conversions from/to
  'geopotential height'. Added HARP_UNIT_GEOPOTENTIAL.

* Renamed cloud optical thickness to cloud optical depth.

* Added '-a/--operations' option to harpdump.

* Support for HDF4 and HDF5 (for import/export) is now optional when building
  HARP, but still enabled by default.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added Python interface.

* CODA is no longer included as part of HARP, but is treated as a separate
  package, just like HDF4 and HDF5.

* The CMake build system can now be used to build HARP on Windows and create
  a binary installer (using WIX).

* Revised and renumbered error codes in C interface.
  Renamed HARP_ERROR_SCRIPT and HARP_ERROR_SCRIPT_SYNTAX error codes to
  HARP_ERROR_ACTION and HARP_ERROR_ACTION_SYNTAX. Changed HARP_ERROR_PRODUCT
  to either HARP_ERROR_INGESTION or HARP_ERROR_IMPORT depending on context.
  Added HARP_ERROR_EXPORT, HARP_ERROR_INVALID_PRODUCT and
  HARP_ERROR_INVALID_VARIABLE.

* The HARP command line tools now link against the dynamic HARP library
  instead of the static version.

* Updated embedded expat library to version 2.1.1.

* Updated embedded udunits2 library to version 2.2.20.
  Also removed the HARP specific udunits XML configuration file since all
  HARP units are now included in udunits2.

* Renamed all 'stdev' variables to 'uncertainty'.

* Fixed parsing of dimension names; string dimension could be interpreted as
  independent dimension.

* Improved the efficiency of the conversion from volume mixing ratio to number
  density and vice versa.

* Update of S5P L2 ingestion module to the lastest version of the product
  format specification (S5P-KNMI-L2-0009-SD and relevant DLR PUMs).

* Update of S5P L1B ingestion module to the lastest version of the product
  format specification (S5P-KNMI-L01B-0012-SD).

* Added ingestion modules for the following product types:
    - Ozone CCI L2 limb profile
    - Ozone CCI L3 limb profile
    - Ozone CCI L2 nadir profile
    - Ozone CCI L3 nadir profile
    - Ozone CCI L4 nadir profile
    - Ozone CCI L2 total column
    - Ozone CCI L3 total column

* Added public functions harp_get_fill_value_for_type(),
  harp_get_valid_min_for_type(), harp_get_valid_max_for_type(),
  harp_is_fill_value_for_type(), harp_is_valid_min_for_type(),
  harp_is_valid_max_for_type(), harp_ingest_test(),
  harp_doc_list_conversions(), harp_doc_export_ingestion_definitions(),
  harp_geometry_get_point_distance(), harp_geometry_has_point_in_area(),
  harp_geometry_has_area_overlap(), harp_basename(),
  harp_product_execute_actions(), harp_variable_set_description(),
  harp_variable_set_unit(), harp_variable_set_string_data_element(),
  harp_variable_verify(), harp_product_set_source_product(),
  harp_product_set_history(), harp_product_verify()

* Added public functions for dealing with HARP collocations.

* Moved defines for default harp units to harp.h.

* Added operators =& and !& to the product actions to test integer variables
  against a bit mask, where a =& mask is equivalent to (a & mask) != 0 and
  a !& mask is equivalent to (a & mask) == 0.

* Added functions to verify the internal consistency as well as compliance to
  HARP conventions of harp_product and harp_variable instances. Any instance
  of harp_product returned by harp_import() or harp_ingest() has been verified
  using these functions.

* Added derived variable conversion from 'latitude {latitude}' (mid-points) to
  'latitude_bounds {latitude, independent}' (bounds); similar for longitude.

* Updated HDF5 data format such that HDF5 products written by HARP are
  compatible with netCDF-4. HDF5 dimension scales are used to represent shared
  dimensions. The "dims" dataset attribute has been deprecated.

* Changed netCDF-3/HDF4/HDF5 backends to be more explicit about implicitly
  created dimensions (which are used to store scalars and strings for formats
  that do not support this natively).

* Fixed handling of scalars and empty strings in netCDF-3/HDF4/HDF5 backends.

* Fixed unit attribute name in HARP products ('unit' -> 'units').

* Changed all constants to be in line with CODATA 2014 as published by NIST.

0.1 2015-11-09
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* First beta release (using CODA 2.15).
